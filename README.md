===============================
Play game here: http://victoria-front-enddev.github.io/Udacity-Project-3/
The aim of the game is to move player safely accross the screen avoiding collisions with bugs.
Player character is chosen randomly.
To move the player use arrow keys: up, down, left and right arrows move the player accordingly one step up, down, left and right.
The player cannot be moved offscreen.
Colliding with bugs resets the game, placing the player to the starting position.
